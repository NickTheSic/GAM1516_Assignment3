How to play:
WASD to move
F To pickup
Space to throw and Attack
Shift to block

There are Barrels above you to hit and pickup
Go left and walk over the switch to open the door
Stay on the second switch to bring the door towards you
Follow the Wall back to hide from the arrows
Grab the shield and hit the checkpoint
Walk back through the arrows
Go to the right room and there is a Raccoon AI that patrols and when he sees you he runs towards you
Push a barrel onto the switch and make sure it stays on the switch so you can have the door stay open
If you wanna test, the Raccoon stops when he hears a sound and then continues on his path
Once the door is held open, you can go up from the main room
Hold down the SHIFT key to use the shield as you walk through the Arrows 
The second enemy that sees you will start spawning projectiles and can be destroyed
Keep going up to find the Heart piece that increases your Max health
That is the end of the level
